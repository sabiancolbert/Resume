		Staying Outside The Box
	</h1>
	<p>
		In a world full of controversy and conflicting ideas, everybody wants to think that they're right. Well so do we. In this relaxed yet exciting podcast, us two brothers attempt to take on the most controversial topics that we can think of. Since there's no one rule book on how to live life, we try to provide a nice middle ground of ideas to work with. Most importantly, we try to look at every option, every belief, every box... and try to stay outside of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Available on most podcasting platforms, we attempt to give an environment where everybody feels heard, every side is given a chance, and every box is smashed. However, no matter how hard we try, we are still only people who are subject to our own biases and opinions, so we hope that you can forgive us if you disagree with what we have to say. That being said, it should still be a pleasant and enjoyable environment to hang out with for a little bit.
